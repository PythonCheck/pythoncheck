PythonCheck
===========

I was instructed to write a README file. So here I am, writing this file, no idea what to write… So I just let my mind being carried away.

This file is intended to be read (not that anyone would ever feel the need to do so). Being an IT guy makes us think we don't need any help. Instruction manual? Never heard of it. I am an IT expert! I don't need no help.

`> ERROR!`

»How on earth did that happen? I am a fucking programmer! I told you to work!« After failing for hours (perhaps even days) to fix it you decide that it might be worth to take a look 'round the internet. Finding yourself on some pretty cool site called [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) you find a solution citing from the README file. So… did our story's hero learn from it? Of course he didn't! He's a fucking IT expert! He knows better!

I am sure you aren't one of those guys. You _always_ read the README file. Of course you do! It's important! I ask you: did you open this file or did you just see the contents on the github project's landing page?

Having finished this really worthwhile text it might have even made fun writing it :)
